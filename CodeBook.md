Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project Codebook
===================================================

Data Sources
------------

This project utilizes the UCI HAR Dataset available online at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. 

Feature Selection
-----------------

The UCI HAR Dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements made by 30 individual test subjects, with individual data vectors then classified as one of six different activity types. The resulting data is then divided into one training set and one test set. 

This project combines the training and test datasets, excludes all but the mean and standard deviation measurements for each feature, and then calculates the mean value of each measurement for each activity type per test subject. For detailed information on how each factor is computed in the original UCI HAR Dataset, please see the "Feature Description" section below which has been included verbatim from the original dataset documentation.

Feature Description 
-------------------

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
